# Smart-Streetlight-System-based-on-VLC

In this project, we propose a visible light communication(VLC) based smart streetlight system for the daytime in the inclement weather. The proposed system can collect the informations of the external environments that are sensed by using IoT sensors and send the decision whether streetlights turn on or not by itself via VLC. From the performance evaluation, we can see the machine learning model for the proposed system can successfully decide whether streetlights turn or not by itself.
